    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came
    and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided
    to
    add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
    that
    someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
    Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
    fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth,
            Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
            While in exile,
            he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in
            TA 2799. He
            fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield
            broke, and,
            using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which
            remained with him
            even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long
            nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
